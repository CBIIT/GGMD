Create a database to store all compounds across generations

Implement chemical space method

Test and compare optimization of FNL gmd vs LC gmd vs other methods for logP problem

Implement forcing data types being passed to and from functions (i.e. optimize function to generative_network.py should pass in a dataframe and return a dataframe)

Look into package CReM (Chemically reasonable mutations)

Look at how Kevin is generalizing the genetic optimizer
