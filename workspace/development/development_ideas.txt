Create a database to store all compounds across generations

Implement chemical space method

Test and compare optimization of FNL gmd vs LC gmd vs other methods for logP problem

Implement forcing data types being passed to and from functions (i.e. optimize function to generative_network.py should pass in a dataframe and return a dataframe)

Look into package CReM (Chemically reasonable mutations)

Look at how Kevin is generalizing the genetic optimizer


In optimizer.select method, df.sample can have a parameter called weights which allows you to assign a column. Rows with larger
values in that column are more likely to be sampled. Could be a potential to weight the sampling towards stronger molecules.
