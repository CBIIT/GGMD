Create a database to store all compounds across generations

Implement chemical space method

Implement forcing data types being passed to and from functions (i.e. optimize function to generative_network.py should pass in a dataframe and return a dataframe)

Look into package CReM (Chemically reasonable mutations)


In optimizer.select method, df.sample can have a parameter called weights which allows you to assign a column. Rows with larger
values in that column are more likely to be sampled. Could be a potential to weight the sampling towards stronger molecules.
